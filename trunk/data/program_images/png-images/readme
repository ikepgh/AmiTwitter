If you prefer to use .png images for the interface buttons, just copy these eight images to the 'program_images' directory.  I recommend storing the original eight images somewhere or make a backup before copying these .png images to that directory.

You should be able to use these on OS 3.x as well, assuming you have the proper .png datatype, AISS, etc. installed...
