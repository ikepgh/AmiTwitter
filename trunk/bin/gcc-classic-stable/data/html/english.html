<HR>
<CENTER>What are the requirements for AmiTwitter?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: MUI, HTMLtext, URLtext, TheBar, BetterString, libiconv.ixlibrary.  OpenURL is optional. </CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER>AmiTwitter does not download or send Tweets?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer:  Are you connected to the internet, have you entered your
Twitter User Name/Password in the Tools -> Settings window and saved them? Are you already following some people (for <I>Timeline</I> to work) and have you sent some Tweets (for <I>My Tweets</I> to work)?</CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER>Direct Messages don't seem to work?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: Ensure you enter the recipient's Screen Name (i.e. User Name) correctly, it does not currently accept user id numbers.</CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER>I like AmiTwitter, how do I donate?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: Follow the 'Donate' link to the PayPal website that opens in your favorite web browser</CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER>Nothing happens when I click on the links at the very bottom of the main
program window (OS3.x)?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: Ensure OpenURL is properly installed/configured.</CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER>All I see is the message, 'Attempting to get the latest...'?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: Most probable reason is you don't have anything in that particular timeline.  For instance, you have never 'Favorited' any items on the Twitter site, and therefore they won't show up under 'My Favorites' in AmiTwitter either.</CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER>Why is the file size so large?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: Because AmiTwitter relies on numerous libs to work, namely: cURL, SSL, xml2, glib, etc....</CENTER><BR>

<CENTER>What is AmiTwitter based on?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: xTwitter by Tsukasa Hamano </CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER>Links in the main Tweets window don't work?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: This is not a webbrowser...Also...it is a limitation of HTMLtext.mcc currently being used (The plan is to switch to HTMLview.mcc in the future...)</CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<CENTER>What are the  future plans for AmiTwitter?</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Answer: First, learn more of the Twitter API, but it depends a lot on the feedback I recieve.  Also, ports to other systems (i.e OS 4.x and AROS) and an active source code base with some developers joining the project at SourceForge would be nice...<BR>
